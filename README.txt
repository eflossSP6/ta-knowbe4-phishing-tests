This is an add-on powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder.

Interval should be one day to not pull duplicates.  Looks for campaigns ran in past 180 days, then logs if the phishing security test was delivered, opened, clicked, or any type of action taken by a recipient if it occurred within the past day.

May be issues with pagination that will need to be fixed.  Need to look into adding other KnowBe4 inputs that may be wanted.
